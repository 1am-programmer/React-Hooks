# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Got it, let's simplify it. Here's a shorter version:

# React Hooks Project

This is a simple React project demonstrating the usage of various React hooks.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

Project Overview:
This project aims to:

Demonstrate the power and versatility of React Hooks.
Showcase best practices for building React applications using functional components.
Provide a hands-on example of how to manage state, side effects, and other common patterns using Hooks.

Features:
State Management with useState: Utilize the useState hook for managing component state.
Effect Handling with useEffect: Handle side effects, such as data fetching and subscriptions, using the useEffect hook.
Context API and useContext: Implement global state management and sharing data between components using the Context API and the useContext hook.
Custom Hooks: Create custom Hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and promote code organization and reusability.
Optimization Techniques: Implement optimization techniques such as memoization, useCallback, and useMemo to improve performance.
